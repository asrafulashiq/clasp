This repository contains the codes for CLASP2. First store the detection bounding box, probability scores and class labels
in a *.pkl* file by running `write_pkl_bin.py`. Please edit the *file_num* and *camera*
parameters as your need. Then use `main.py` to start the detection and tracking algorithm.
